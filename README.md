I'm using http-server which is a super simple dev server. It's on npm as http-server and I installed it globally so i can run it in the command line. 
I may end up using my own express.js server setup but this will work for now. 
I have the phaser first game tutorial in a sub-directory of the public folder. I'm going to be working from that folder. 
once i run http-server in the command line from the project's directory, I then open http://localhost:8080/tutorial to view the project.
